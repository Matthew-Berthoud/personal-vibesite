# personal-vibesite

## Overview
Simple personal website and a Go server written with "vibe coding".
I've procrastinated making a personal website for so long I finally put my prompt engineering skills to the test and vibe coded my way there. I played the role of Senior Dev building this site, letting the chat bot get their hands dirty. Look around to see what you think of my delegation skills!
